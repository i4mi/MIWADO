Bower Example Project
==========================

A very small project to show how the MIDATA.js package can be consumed from
ES5 and the bower package manager.

    $ bower install i4mi/midata.js --save

Include it in your index.html before your application source files:

    <!-- Include the library from your bower components directory -->
    <script src="bower_components/midata.js/dist/midata.js"></script>

    <!-- Your own source files -->
    ...
